        <p>
          The Internet has been built upon the fruits of open source for more than twenty years.
          Whenever a project enabled new capabilities it was (whether desired or not) added to the stack
          becoming a new foundation for what came next.
          The maintainers became thanklessly unpaid volunteers.

          <strong>Web 2.0 accrued fortunes on the backs of this free labor.</strong>

        <p>
          <span class="tea">tea</span> manages the graph of open source that underpins all modern digital infrastructure.
          We‚Äôre putting it <i>on&hyphen;chain</i> creating a <i>map</i> we‚Äôll use to guide value redistribution to the open source that makes the Internet possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We‚Äôre not changing how open source works‚Äî<i>it‚Äôs still free.</i>
          web3 has introduced powerful new paradigms that allow value to be compensated without direct
          payment. Creator economy, meet open source.
