          open source</span> revolution.
        </h2>
        <p>
          For more than twenty years the Internet has been built upon the fruits of freely available open source.
          Whenever a project enabled new functionality it was
            (whether desired or not)
            added as a new brick in the tower of infrastructure;
            giving the Internet new powers and capabilities;
            becoming a new foundation for all the innovations that followed.
          The maintainers of these new bricks became thanklessly unpaid volunteers.
        </p>
        <h3><span class="alt">The</span> Homebrew <span class="alt">Story</span>.</h3>
        <p>
          Homebrew has been used by tens of millions of creators to build things we all use every day,
            and yet Max Howell—the creator of <code>brew</code> and co&hyphen;founder of <span class="tea">tea</span>—was
            unable to make a living from Homebrew alone.
          Maintaining such a large project was more than a full&hyphen;time job but every few years Max
            would have to go back to working on somebody else’s idea for money.
          Of the countless enterprises that have utilized Homebrew,
            only two have ever said thanks:
          Google sent him a blanket and Square sent him an iPad.
          As generous as (the iPad) was, small gifts don’t pay bills.
          We’re making sure such a thing never happens again and that open source developers
            can focus on building things they love without compromise.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: smaller; text-align: right">
          <a href="https://medium.com/teaxyz/tea-brew-478a9e736638">Max tells the story himself at Medium →</a>
        </p>
        <h3><span class="alt">Tech giants accrued fortunes on the backs of people they’ve</span> never thanked, paid or even met.</h3>
        <p>
          The problem has always existed, but the technology to solve it hasn’t.
          <span class="tea">tea</span> facilitates the graph of open source that underpins all modern digital infrastructure.
          We’re putting it <i>on&hyphen;chain</i> creating a <i>map</i>
            we’ll use to guide value redistribution to the open source that makes the Internet possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re not changing how open source works—<i>it’s still free.</i>
          web3 has introduced powerful new paradigms that allow value to be compensated without direct payment.
          Creator economy, meet open source.
